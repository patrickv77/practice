applied accessability

--------------

alt tags when and when not to use

h1-h6 should be organized in a meaningful and heirarchical fashion
    there should only by one h1 ever
    h2 subsection of h1, h3 subsection of h2 etc. do not skip from h2 to h4 because it looks better, use css to change relative sizings

renaming div elements as article, nav, footer, main etc to help with readability/accessability

audio tag for audio elements
    putting control within the tag brings up play pause volume controls

figure/figcaption for more descriptive pictures

use for with id in labels

fieldset and legend for radio buttons (or groups of buttons/checkboxes etc)

can make screen-reader only content and hide it off screen

higher contrast ratio for readability

can achieve different contrast ratio with hue, saturation, lightness as well as just changing the colors

use more meaningful descriptors for anchor tags (dont use "click here" or "read more") 

accesskey to assign hotkeys to links or buttons etc

apply tabindex to text to highlight it when user tabs through page
    can also determine the tab order of items when you tab through a page

can use @media query to change css rules dependent on width or height of device

responsive image:
    img {
        max-width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }

use smaller images (retina image, generally half of normal resolution) to increase clarity
